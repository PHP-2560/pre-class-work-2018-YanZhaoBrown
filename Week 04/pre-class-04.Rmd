### Question 1:

Using a loop, print the integers from 1 to 50. 

```{r}
for (i in 1:50) {
  print(i)
}
```

### Question 2:

A.  Using a loop, add all the integers between 0 and 1000.

```{r}
sum = 0
for (i in 0:1000) {
  sum = sum + i
}
sum
```

B. Now, add all the EVEN integers between 0 and 1000 (hint: use seq())

```{r}
sum = 0
x = seq(from = 0, to = 1000, by = 1)
for (i in 1:length(x)) {
  if (x[i] %% 2 == 0) {
    sum = sum + x[i] 
  }
}
sum
```

C. Now, repeat A and B WITHOUT using a loop.

```{r}
##Repeating for A
x = 0:1000
sum_a = sum(x)
sum_a

##Repeating for B
sum(x[x %%2 == 0])

```

### Question 3:

Here is a dataframe of survey data containing 5 questions :

```{r, eval=FALSE}
survey <- data.frame(
                     "participant" = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
                     "q1" = c(5, 3, 2, 7, 11, 0),
                     "q2" = c(4, 2, 2, 5, -10, 99),
                     "q3" = c(-4, -3, 4, 2, 9, 10),
                     "q4" = c(-30, 5, 2, 23, 4, 2),
                     "q5" = c(88, 4, -20, 2, 4, 2)
                     )
```
The response to each question should be an integer between 1 and 5. Obviously, we have some bad values in the dataframe. The goal of this problem is to fix them.

A. Using a loop, create a new dataframe called survey.clean where all the invalid values (those that are not integers between 1 and 5) are set to NA.

```{r}
survey.clean = survey
for (i in 1:dim(survey.clean)[1]) {
  for (j in 2:dim(survey.clean)[2]) {
    if (survey[i,j] <1 | survey[i,j] > 5) {
      survey.clean[i,j] = NA
    }
  }
}
survey.clean
```

B. Now, again using a loop, add a new column to the dataframe called “invalid.answers” that indicates, for each participant, how many bad answers they gave.

```{r}
invalid.answer = vector(mode = "numeric", length = dim(survey.clean)[1])
for (i in 1:dim(survey.clean)[1]) {
  invalid.answer[i] = sum(survey.clean[i,-1], na.rm =TRUE)
}
cbind(survey.clean, invalid.answer)
```
